  <h3><font color="yellow">The Lakers!</font></h3>
    <p1> Lebron recently adquired Anthony Davis to play with him in the Lakers they traded alot for him but still kept Kyle Kuzma</p1>
    <p2> These are the possible free agents that can come to the Lakers</p2>
    <ul>Kyrie irving</ul>
    <ul>Kemba Walker</ul>
    <ul>Kawhi Leonard</ul>
    <ul>Jimmy Butler</ul>
    <ul>Tobias Harris</ul>
    <p3>I hope that we at least get one of them to play with Lebron , Anthony and kyle</p3>
